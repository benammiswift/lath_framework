Lath gets it's name from wooden laths and is intended to form a similar function for you when developing your train, this 
being to provide a solid framework for you to build your solution over the top of.

This project was born out of a lot of time being wasted interacting with the base TS functions, reimplementing the same solution for different problems
many times over and just a general feel that the functions TS provides could do with a layer of abstraction to make them a little more dev friendly.
